Restructure how freedombox is set up?

At the moment, the dreambox and virtualbox images for freedombox are
set up quite differently, using different package lists to install and
different scripts to configure the images.  I belive this is
unfortunate, and suggest a way to change this.

I suggest the code to set up the freedombox is moved to a new debian
package (lets name it freedombox-setup), and the packages to install
are listed as dependencies for this package.

The content of the package should be something like this:

  /usr/lib/freedombox/setup
  /usr/lib/freedombox/setup.d/
    01_privoxy
    80_package-sources
    99_prepare-first-boot

  /etc/init.d/
    first-boot
    proxy

The image creation for both should call the /usr/lib/freedombox/setup
script, which in turn call the scripts in setup.d to configure various
parts of the image.  At the end of the setup phase, Any think needed
to prepare before the first boot is done, and the image should be
ready to boot.
