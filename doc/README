Using your FreedomBox
============================

This section describes the basic information you need to know to successfully
use your FreedomBox.

Quick Start
------------------------------

#. Plug one end of your ethernet cord into your FreedomBox's eth1_ port (the one
   toward the end of the box), and plug the other end into your router.

#. Plug your computer into the eth0_ port (the one toward the middle of the box)
   on the FreedomBox.

#. Plug your FreedomBox into a power outlet.

#. Wait a few minutes while it starts itself for the first time.

#. Start enjoying the Internet.

#. Navigate to your FreedomBox by browsing to::

    http://freedombox

#. Bask in your own awesomeness :)

Now, you can try:

* `Browsing the Internet`_
* `Hosting a Wiki`_
* `Publishing with your FreedomBox`_

Other tools are also planned, such as an IM (chat) server, a blog, and more.

Browsing the Internet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To browse the Internet through your FreedomBox:

#. Plug one end of your ethernet cord into your FreedomBox's eth1_ port (the one
   toward the end of the box), and plug the other end into your router.

#. Plug your computer into the eth0_ port (the one toward the middle of the box)
   on the FreedomBox.

#. Start enjoying the Internet.

Hosting a Wiki
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. `Connect to your FreedomBox`_, as root, because we're going to modify the
   system by installing some new packages.

#. Install the ikiwiki package::

    $ apt-get install ikiwiki

   Say "yes" when it asks you about installing new packages.

#. Follow the `ikiwiki setup instructions`_, or use the `additional projects`_
   to automatically configure ikiwiki.

.. _ikiwiki setup instructions: http://ikiwiki.info/setup/

Publishing with your FreedomBox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that you've put a wiki together, you might as well publish it to the
Internet.  To publish material to the Internet, you need two things:

#. A place to host it.

#. A name, so you can be found.

You already have the place to host data, it's this FreedomBox.  Now, you just
need a name.

While it's possible to buy your own domain name, it's a rather tedious and
complicated process.  Many folks have had good luck with "reverse proxies,"
things like PageKite_.  Other `reverse proxy services`_ are also available.

.. _reverse proxy services: http://alternativeto.net/software/pagekite/

.. _pagekite:

Publishing with PageKite
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Getting started with PageKite is pretty straightforward.  After you've
`connected to your FreedomBox`_ you'll need to download and start PageKite.

#. Download PageKite::

    $ curl -s https://pagekite.net/pk/ |sudo bash

#. Start PageKite, replacing ``yourname`` with your site's name::

    $ pagekite.py 80 yourname.pagekite.me

Now, you can access http://yourname.pagekite.me/ from anywhere!

Common Tasks
-------------------------------

Some tasks require a bit of command line magic.  We've reproduced that magic
here, so it's easy to refer to, when you need it.

Logging in to your FreedomBox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your FreedomBox first starts, it has two accounts: a root account for
system maintenance, and a normal user who doesn't have the power to mess with
how the system works.  The default passwords for each of those users are:

:root: freedom
:fbx: frdm

You'll need this information if you want to log in, as explained in the next
section.  Also, after you log in, you should probably `change the default
passwords`_.  Otherwise, anybody else who reads this document could log into
your box, too.

.. _connected to your freedombox:
.. _connect to your freedombox:

Connecting to your FreedomBox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions will teach you how to log in, via ssh, to your FreedomBox.

#. Run an ethernet cord from your computer to your FreedomBox's eth0 port (the
   one toward the middle).

#. Wait a bit, or until your computer says that it's successfully connected.

#. Run the following command to log in as the administrative, everyday, user::

    $ ssh fbx@freedombox

   To log in as the root user instead, in case you want to perform some serious
   system maintenance::

    $ ssh root@freedombox

Make a habit of logging in as root *only when you need to*.  If you aren't
logged in as root, you can't accidentally break everything.  Even if everything
does break though, don't worry, it can still be fixed, it'll just take a couple
hours.  See the `Getting Help`_ section for more details.

.. _change the default passwords:

Changing your Password
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To change your password, log in to your FreedomBox as the user whose password
you want to change.  Then, run the following command:

    $ passwd

That'll ask you for your current password before giving you the opportunity to
put in a new one.

Updating your FreedomBox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These instructions will teach you how to keep your FreedomBox up to date with
the latest software releases.

#. Ask the box to update itself::

    $ apt-get update; apt-get upgrade

Chances are good the "upgrade" command will ask you if it's alright to install
some packages and use some disk space.  Say "yes", because that's what you want
it to do.

If those commands complete successfully, then congratulations, you've just
updated your FreedomBox!  If they don't complete successfully ask for help, as
described in the `Getting Help`_ section.

Ever wonder what all those holes and fiddly bits were called?

Warnings
-------------------------------

* If you need to open the box, open it from the side that's not the AC Adapter
  side.  Be very careful here: the box's two halves are held together, on the
  adapter side, by a couple fragile wires.

Hacking on your FreedomBox
============================

Your FreedomBox includes several projects you can check out:

* Freedom Maker
* Plinth
* Privoxy

To start using these projects, navigate to the relevant folder in the
``/home/fbx`` directory and examine their README files.

Projects
-----------------------------

Freedom Maker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Freedom Maker is the tool used to create a running FreedomBox system.  It
creates the bootable system image that lives on the DreamPlug's microSD card.

http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=freedombox/freedom-maker.git;a=summary

Plinth
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plinth is the FreedomBox's administration UI.  It's not done yet, but it will be
included in future FreedomBox updates when it's finished.

https://github.com/jvasile/Plinth

Privoxy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Privoxy is the FreedomBox's privacy-preserving web-proxy.

https://github.com/jvasile/freedombox-privoxy

Building your own FreedomBox
----------------------------

Updating DreamPlug's U-Boot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also review these instructions online:

    http://wiki.debian.org/FreedomBox/Firmware

These instructions are from Ian Campbell, using uboot version 2012.04.01-2,
which is the current version in Debian's Wheezy release.

Prepare your system::

    # wget http://http.debian.net/debian/pool/main/u/u-boot/u-boot_2012.04.01-2_armel.deb
    # dpkg-deb -x u-boot_2012.04.01-2_armel.deb u-boot_2012.04.01-2_armel
    # cp -r u-boot_2012.04.01-2_armel/usr/lib/u-boot/dreamplug /mnt

Move the USB drive to your DreamPlug, and connect to your system via JTAG.
Connect the UART DreamPlug port to the JTAG Board's UART port or connect the
JTAG DreamPlug port to the JTAG Board's JTAG port.  Next, plug the USB cord into
your main system and access the serial port with::

    # screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200

Now, interrupt the boot process so you can flash it from within the bootloader,
before the GNU/Linux system takes over::

    > usb start
    > fatload usb 2 0x6400000 dreamplug/u-boot.kwb
    > sf probe 0
    > sf erase 0x0 0x80000
    > sf write 0x6400000 0x0 0x${filesize}

You must, of course, fill in the size of the file you're loading in hex.  At
this point, you should be able to reset the DreamPlug and have it boot to a
serial console prompt.  If that fails, you'll need real JTAG magic to try again.

Note that freedom-maker now includes DreamPlug firmware in the FAT partition on
USB stick targets.  To use a freedom-maker USB stick to update your u-boot,
ignore the instructions above about how to wget and extract the firmware, and
just connect to the DreamPlug and follow the bootloader instructions.

Building your own File-system Image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On another system, download the Freedom-Maker repoistory and follow the README
to build your own image that you can plug into your DreamPlug::

    $ git clone git://anonscm.debian.org/freedombox/freedom-maker.git ~/freedom-maker

.. _additional projects:

Adding Additional Projects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are a number of incomplete projects that you might find useful, for
setting up a wiki, an IM server, and so forth.  To check these out, download the
repository::

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/nickdaly/plugserver ~/plugserver

Then, read the README.  It's pretty detailed.  A word of warning, though: the
FreedomBox Foundation folks think that using PHP-based services, like the blog
service included in that plugserver repository, is a generally poor idea.  Just
use the wiki instead.

Also, if you can, it may be best to wait until these tools are fully integrated
into the FreedomBox image.  Otherwise, migrating from these custom tools to the
officially supported FreedomBox tools may be difficult.  Ultimately, that
decision is up to you.
