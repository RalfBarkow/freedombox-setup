# This lintian check is meant for making sure there are no clashes
# when Apache configuration files are installed.  Given the uniqueness
# of the name for FreedomBox configuration (freedombox.conf), this is
# taken care of.  freedombox-setup is configure Apache for FreedomBox
# and not for itself.
freedombox-setup binary: non-standard-apache2-configuration-name freedombox.conf != freedombox-setup.conf
