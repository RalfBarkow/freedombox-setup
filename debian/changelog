freedombox-setup (0.0.9) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Petter Reinholdtsen ]
  * Add key-report and freedombox-todos to list of repositories feched
    by setup.d/70_fetch-projects.  Drop exmachina, now integrated with
    plinth.
  * Added setup.d/05_apt-sources to disable cdrom APT sources after
    installation, to make sure plinth can install packages without
    asking for a CD to be installed.
  * Rewrote setup.d/30_dnsmasq-server to split config in three
    parts, one static and two that could change.

  [ Nick Daly ]
  * Added setup.d/01_etckeeper-pre to store /etc/ status before
    applying FreedomBox setup.
  * Added code to use snakeoil SSL certificate with Apache, and put
    plinth behind this https connection.

  * Fix typo in update-rc.d arguments in rules file.
  * Adjust setup.d/80_plinth to create apache site file with .conf
    ending to work with apache2 in Jessie.

freedombox-setup (0.0.6) wheezy; urgency=low

  * Pull in libnss-myhostname and remove host name from /etc/hosts, to
    avoid having to update /etc/hosts when the local hostname change.
  * Drop unused wajig as dependency.
  * Make sure to commit the current status of /etc/ at the end of the
    setup.d run.
  * Adjust 90_jwchat to only update ejabberd.cfg once if it is executed
    several times.

freedombox-setup (0.0.5) wheezy; urgency=low

  * Drop prosody from dependencies, as jwchat pull in ejabberd and two
    XMPP servers should not be running at the same time on the
    Freedombox.
  * Drop isc-dhcp-server from dependencies and disable
    setup.d/40_dhcp-server for now, as dnsmasq is also providing a
    DHCP server and we only need one DHCP server.  As dnsmasq also is
    the DNS server, it can not be removed without a larger rewrite of
    the setup.
  * Make sure the jwchat and ejabberd configuration contain the
    correct hostname and ejabberd have mod_http_bind enabled to get
    XMPP and jwchat working out of the box.  Patch from James
    Valleroy.

  * Add new setup.d/91_privoxy to set up freedombox-privoxy.
  * Remove plinth related call for 'a2enmod rewrite' in first-run, as it
    is already done in setup.d/80_plinth and do not have to happen
    during first boot.
  * Rewrite first-run and proxy script to use log_* functions for output.
  * Rewrite first-run script from bash to Bourne sh, to avoid the need
    to load bash during boot.

freedombox-setup (0.0.2) wheezy; urgency=low

    /usr/sbin/.
