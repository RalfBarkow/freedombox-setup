    package.
  * Depend on how-can-i-help to let every user of apt know about
    problems with 'our' packages.

  * Update Standards-Version from 3.9.4 to 3.9.5.  No changes needed.
  * Add dependency on unattended-upgrades to make it easier to handle
    upgrades.
  * Rename init.d scripts first-run to freedombox-first-run and proxy to
    freedombox-client-proxy, to make it easier to see in /etc/init.d/
    which scripts belong to the freedombox setup.
  * Adjust freedombox-first-run boot dependencies to run after
    firewalld, tor, haveged, lxc and pagekite, in case those are
    needed to set up the system.

    naming with the other sbin tools in this package.
  * Rename setup.d/10_dreamplug to setup.d/10_hardware to better reflect
    its current task.

    can tell.
  * Drop lua-sec, python-augeas, python-beautifulsoup,
    python-bjsonrpc, python-docutils and python-lxml from
    dependencies.  None of them are used, as far as I can tell, and

    them.
  * Drop python-argparse from dependencies, it is now a virtal package
    provided by libpython2.7-stdlib.
  * Add dblatex, w3m and zip as build dependencies for the new

  * Removed libpython2.7 as dependency.  As far as 'aptitude why' can
    see, depending on python-augeas is enough to pull it in.
