  * Pull in libnss-myhostname and remove host name from /etc/hosts, to
    avoid having to update /etc/hosts when the local hostname change.
  * Drop unused wajig as dependency.

freedombox-setup (0.0.5) wheezy; urgency=low

  * Drop prosody from dependencies, as jwchat pull in ejabberd and two
    XMPP servers should not be running at the same time on the
    Freedombox.
  * Drop isc-dhcp-server from dependencies and disable
    setup.d/40_dhcp-server for now, as dnsmasq is also providing a
    DHCP server and we only need one DHCP server.  As dnsmasq also is
    the DNS server, it can not be removed without a larger rewrite of
    the setup.
  * Make sure the jwchat and ejabberd configuration contain the
    correct hostname and ejabberd have mod_http_bind enabled to get
    XMPP and jwchat working out of the box.  Patch from James
    Valleroy.

    during first boot.
  * Rewrite first-run and proxy script to use log_* functions for output.
  * Rewrite first-run script from bash to Bourne sh, to avoid the need
    to load bash during boot.
