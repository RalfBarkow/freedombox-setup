  * Pull in libnss-myhostname and remove host name from /etc/hosts, to
    avoid having to update /etc/hosts when the local hostname change.

  * Make sure to commit the current status of /etc/ at the end of the
    setup.d run.

freedombox-setup (0.0.5) wheezy; urgency=low

  * Drop prosody from dependencies, as jwchat pull in ejabberd and two
    XMPP servers should not be running at the same time on the
    Freedombox.
  * Drop isc-dhcp-server from dependencies and disable
    setup.d/40_dhcp-server for now, as dnsmasq is also providing a
    DHCP server and we only need one DHCP server.  As dnsmasq also is
    the DNS server, it can not be removed without a larger rewrite of
    the setup.
  * Make sure the jwchat and ejabberd configuration contain the
    correct hostname and ejabberd have mod_http_bind enabled to get
    XMPP and jwchat working out of the box.  Patch from James
    Valleroy.

  * Add new setup.d/91_privoxy to set up freedombox-privoxy.
  * Remove plinth related call for 'a2enmod rewrite' in first-run, as it
    is already done in setup.d/80_plinth and do not have to happen
    during first boot.
  * Rewrite first-run and proxy script to use log_* functions for output.
  * Rewrite first-run script from bash to Bourne sh, to avoid the need
    to load bash during boot.
