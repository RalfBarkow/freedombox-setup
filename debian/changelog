freedombox-setup (0.0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Do not depend on jwchat, but instead pull it in using a setup.d
    script, to avoid failing to install when jwchat fail to install like
    it currently do in testing.
  * Add new helper script dreamplug-detect, and move all sbin tools to
    /usr/sbin/.
